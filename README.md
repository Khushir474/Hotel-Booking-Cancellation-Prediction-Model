# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction-Model
## Project Overview
Developing a predictive model to forecast hotel booking cancellations 

## Introduction
In the highly competitive and dynamic hotel industry, the ability to predict customer behavior is a strategic advantage that can significantly enhance operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability. Booking cancellations, alongside room nights, arrivals, and price sensitivity, are pivotal topics in hotel forecasts (Weatherford & Kimes, 2003; Talluri & Van Ryzin, 2005). The advent of sophisticated data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms has opened new avenues for addressing the challenge of predicting booking cancellations with high accuracy. This project proposes the development of a predictive model designed to forecast booking cancellations, leveraging historical reservation data to uncover patterns and factors influencing cancellation likelihood, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making for hotel managers.

## Problem Statement
Booking cancellations pose a significant challenge to revenue management and operational planning in hotels, affecting 20% to 60% of bookings (P. H. Liu, 2004; Morales & Wang, 2010). The unpredictability of cancellations can lead to suboptimal occupancy rates, wasted resources, and lost revenue opportunities. Furthermore, an accurate forecast for booking cancellations is crucial in determining the hotel net demand, which is the demand that remains after deducting predicted cancellations and no-shows (Rajopadhye, Ghalia, Wang, Baker, & Eister, 2001; Talluri & Van Ryzin, 2005). Thus, there is a pressing need for a sophisticated, data-driven approach to predict and mitigate the impact of booking cancellations. This project seeks to develop a predictive model using machine learning and data mining techniques to analyze historical booking data, identifying key predictors of cancellations and enabling targeted strategies to mitigate these risks.  

This project seeks to address this need by developing a predictive model that utilizes machine learning and data mining techniques to analyze historical booking data. The model will identify key predictors of cancellations, such as booking lead times, customer demographics, room preferences, and historical cancellation rates. By understanding the factors that contribute to the probability of a booking being canceled, hoteliers can implement targeted strategies to mitigate these risks. These strategies may include personalized customer engagement, dynamic pricing models, and enhanced service offerings designed to reduce the likelihood of cancellations.
